            Pelumi has given you a detailed history but I would just start from
            when I developed an interest in her. It was the day I took her to
            get a bulb for her room and we got talking for a while because it
            was a long walk to and fro. For some reason that I can‚Äôt remember,
            we spoke on a deep level that painted a picture of her values. I
            started to visit her more often and the more I got to know her, the
            more impressed I was with her values, character, personality,
            spirituality etc. From there on, it went from admiring her absolute
            beauty( the girl too fine abeg)....
